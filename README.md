#geothermal_pfa

The code, scripts, and data files in this repository are related to geothermal research. Most code was developed as part of the geothermal play fairway analysis project at Cornell University (see Acknowledgment and Disclaimer below, Principal Investigator Teresa Jordan, report submitted Oct. 2015). The sub-repositories are for bottom-hole temperature corrections, outliers, and reservoir ideality. The document geothermal_bhts_outliers_documentation.tex provides more detailed information on the scripts, codes, and data. This code is provided under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md).

#Bottom-hole Temperature Corrections
General code used to "correct" bottom-hole temperatures based on depth of the well and location within the Appalachian Basin. Inputs are depth in meters.

#Outliers
Algorithms to identify spatial outliers. There are options for identifying local outliers based on several criteria including the closest n points or points within a certain distance.

#Reservoir Ideality
Code to Monte Carlo the distribution of reservoir ideality based on several input parameters.

#Combining Metrics
Several scripts and files used when combining the risk factors (variables impacting project success) into play fairway risk maps for the region.
